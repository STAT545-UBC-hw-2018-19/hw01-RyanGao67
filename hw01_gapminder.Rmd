## Data frame exploration

### Setting up

First, load the `gapminder` R package. If you don't have it installed, run `install.packages("gapminder")` in the console first.

```{r}
library(gapminder)
```

### What is a data frame?

It's tabular data. To get a sense of this, go ahead and print out the `gapminder` object (you might want to do this in the console!).

### Exploration of data frames

Let's explore `gapminder` with functions like `head`, `ncol`, `str`, `summary`.

### Extracting columns/"variables"
#show data

```{r}
print(gapminder)
```
#show first few rows
```{r}
head(gapminder)
```
#data description
```{r}
str(gapminder)
```
#number of columns
```{r}
ncol(gapminder)
```
#summarize data
```{r}
summary(gapminder)
```

Let's extract a column with `$`. Maybe compute its variance.
